## Learn More

Token Trust currently leverages Uniswap's LP's to fetch historical data of the token from  supported chains (currently mainnet). 

- The data from Uniswap is filtered and algorithmically worked on to generate input parameters for the Giza ML Agent.

- The giza agent runs the zkMLM model and returns with the inference result with a request-id which the users can use the giza-sdk to verify on own, bringing a trustless system where end users can trust the inference.

- According to the prediction, the vault manager on enzyme can handle assets to invest in the token with low rug possibility, or cautions high risk tokens.
